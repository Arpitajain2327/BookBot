📚 BookBot – AI-Powered Book Recommendation Chatbot
BookBot is a conversational AI chatbot built using IBM Watson Assistant that helps users get personalized book recommendations based on their genre preference, mood, or favorite author.

This project was created as part of a summer training program and aims to showcase how artificial intelligence can enhance the user experience in the world of reading and recommendations.

🧠 Features

Preferred genre (Fantasy, Mystery, Sci-Fi, etc.)

Current mood (Happy, Sad, Motivated, etc.)

Favorite authors

🦁 Custom Chatbot Icon: A unique lion-themed icon makes the bot fun and friendly.

💬 Web Integration: Embedded easily into a standalone HTML website using IBM’s Web Chat SDK.

🛠️ Technologies Used
IBM Watson Assistant – For creating intents, entities, dialog flow, and response logic

🌐 Live Demo

(If you'd like, I can help you publish it online so others can try it out.)

🚀 How It Works
The user opens the chatbot-enabled website.

BookBot starts the conversation and asks the user what they're looking for (e.g., a book for a certain mood).

Based on the responses, it uses trained intents and entities to recommend a relevant book.

The bot can loop back and provide more suggestions or end the conversation politely.
